All Photometry routines are to be found here. The code is based on the routines
of Tim Naylor's optimal extraction code. For a thorough explanation of the 
algorithms read the following two papers:

"An Optimal Extraction Algorithm for Imaging Photometry"
Naylor Tim, MNRAS, 296, 399, 1998

"Optimal Photometry for Colour-Magnitude Diagrams and its Application on NGC 2547"
Naylor, Tim et al. MNRAS, 335, 291, 2002

Requirements:
opt_extr.f90 - All the required routines for optimal and aperature photometry
marq.f90     - Computes Marquardt routines needed for profile fitting
cfitsio      - NASA's FITS file manipulation library needs to be installed.

The photometry code compiles by doing the following:
- edit optimal.csh and provide the path for the cfitsio library in your system.
- source optimal.csh

Alternatively (I use g95 but any Fortran compiler will do):
g95 -c opt_extr.f90 marq.f90
g95 -o optimal optimal.f90 marq.o opt_extr.o -L/<Local Path>/cfitsio -lcfitsio

Example:
gfortran -c opt_extr.f90 marq.f90
(you will get a messge that Fatal Error: Can't open module file 'marq.mod'. Just run it again)
gfortran -c opt_extr.f90 marq.f90
then:
gfortran -o optimal optimal.f90 marq.o opt_extr.o -L /usr/local/lib -lcfitsio

Required improvements:
1. Include flagging of bad pixels, bad stars, bad sky etc. This feature was removed from
   The original codein order to make the code independent of the ARK software package.
